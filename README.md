# Winning the Space Race with Data Science

## Overview
This repository contains Python scripts developed for the capstone project of the IBM Data Science Professional Program. The project applies data science techniques to analyze and derive insights from data related to the SpaceX booster landing project. It highlights my approach to solving real-world problems using methodologies such as data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, visualization, statistical analysis, and machine learning.

## Disclaimer
This repository contains my solutions to assignments from the IBM Data Science Professional Program, which I completed on Coursera. Publicly sharing these files was part of the course requirements for the final assignment, and they are included here in compliance with the course guidelines at the time of completion.

Please note that the course material has since been updated, and these assignments may no longer reflect the current content of the program. The purpose of this repository is to showcase my work and the problem-solving skills I developed by completing the capstone project.

If you are currently enrolled in the program, I encourage you to complete the assignments independently to maximize your learning experience.

## Features
- **Data Science Applications in Real-World Projects**: Applied data science methodologies to analyze and study challenges related to the SpaceX rocket booster landing project.
- **Web Scraping and Data Wrangling**: Collected and transformed raw data from web sources and structured datasets, preparing them for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Used visualization and statistical techniques to uncover insights and patterns in the data.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Developed and evaluated predictive models to determine the likelihood of successful booster landings.
- **Visualization and Communication**: Created compelling visualizations and reports to communicate findings effectively.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries/Tools**: pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, scikit-learn

## Purpose
The repository serves as a learning archive and showcases my skill development during the course. It is not intended to provide solutions for current course assignments.

## Contributions
As this repository reflects past coursework, contributions are not actively sought. However, feedback and discussions are always welcome!
