# Winning the Space Race with Data Science

## Overview
This repository contains solutions to assignments from an online course by IBM focused on applying data science techniques to space exploration. It showcases my approach to tackling these tasks and demonstrates problem-solving using data science concepts.

## Disclaimer
This repository contains my solutions to assignments from the IBM Data Science Professional Program, which I completed on Coursera. Publicly sharing these files was part of the course requirements for the final assignment, and they are included here in compliance with the course guidelines at the time of completion.

Please note that the course material has since been updated, and these assignments may no longer reflect the current content of the program. The purpose of this repository is to showcase my work and the problem-solving skills I developed by completing the capstone project.

If you are currently enrolled in the program, I encourage you to complete the assignments independently to maximize your learning experience.

## Features
- **Data Science Applications in Space Exploration**: Analytical techniques applied to simulated space-related challenges.
- **Practical Problem-Solving**: Demonstrates the use of Python libraries and frameworks for data analysis and visualization.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries/Tools**: pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, scikit-learn

## Purpose
The repository serves as a learning archive and showcases my skill development during the course. It is not intended to provide solutions for current course assignments.

## Contributions
As this repository reflects past coursework, contributions are not actively sought. However, feedback and discussions are always welcome!
